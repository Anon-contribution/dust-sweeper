# Pooper Scooper

Solana web3 dapp that allows users to "clean" shit tokens out of their wallet and convert it all to bonk

A basic user interface and usage is implemented in `AssetList.tsx`.

The core logic which performs the application action is `in scooper.ts`

# Usage

Start the development server:
```
yarn start
```

Build artifacts for production deployment:

```

# Notes

Note that the homepage is currently set in `package.json` for a development server and should be changed for other deployments
